          <p class="content">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
          lightweight language allowing maximum flexibilit for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host
          environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide progmmatic control over
          them.</p>
          <p class="content"><a class="links4">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript Variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
          a variable holds a vaule. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <a class="example">var x;</a></p>
          <p class="content"><a class="links4">Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types
          that are JavaScript primites: Boolean - <a class="example">True</a> or <a class="example">false;</a> null - <a class="example">null</a> aka nothing; Number - <a class="example">42</a> or <a class="example">3.14159;</a> String - <a class="example">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</a>
          Array - <a class="example">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</a> and Object - <a class="example">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</a></p>
          <p class="content"><a class="links4">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on
          values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
          conditional statements: <a class="example">if</a> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <a class="example">else if</a> to specify a new condition to test, if the first
          condition is false; <a class="example">else</a> we execute this block of code;</p>
          <p class="content"><a class="links4">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat
          an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</p>
          <p class="content"><a class="links4">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
          instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we
          screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more
          tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</p>
